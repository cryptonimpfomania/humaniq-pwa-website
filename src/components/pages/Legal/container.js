          '<p>Our main priority is your data security here at Humaniq. As transparency is one of the principles on which our company is built, we aim to be as clear and open as we can about the way we handle security.<br/> If you have additional questions regarding security, we are happy to answer them. Please write to <a href="mailto:feedback@humaniq.com" target="_blank">feedback@humaniq.com</a> and we will respond as quickly as we can.</p><h3>Confidentiality</h3><p>We place strict controls over our employees’ access to the data and code you make available via Humaniq services, as morespecifically defined in your agreement with Humaniq covering the use of Humaniq services ("Customer Data"), and are committed to ensuring that Customer Data is not seen by anyone who should not have access to it. The operation of Humaniq services requires thatsome employees have access to the systems which store and process Customer Data. For example, in order to diagnose a problem you are having with Humaniq services, we may need to access your Customer Data. These employees are prohibited from using these permissions to view Customer Data unless it is necessary to do so. We have technical controls and audit policies in place to ensure that any access toCustomer Data is logged. <br/>All of our employees and contract personnel are bound to our policies regarding Customer Data and we treat these issues as matters of the highest importance within our company.</p><h3>Personnel Practices</h3><p>Humaniq conducts background checks on all employees before employment, and employees receive security training during induction as well as on an ongoing basis. All employees are required to read and sign our comprehensive information security policy covering thesecurity, availability, and confidentiality of Humaniq services.</p><h3>Compliance</h3><p>The following security-related audits and certifications are applicable to the Slack services:</p><ul>  <li>Service Organization Control (SOC) Reports: Humaniq is undergoing a SOC 3 audit, and a copy of Humaniq’s most recent report will beavailable upon request.</li>  <li>PCI: Humaniq is not currently a PCI-certified Service Provider. We are a PCI Level 4 Merchant and have completed the Payment CardIndustry Data Security Standard’s SAQ-A, allowing us to use a third party to process your credit card information securely.</li></ul><p>The environment that hosts Humaniq services maintains multiple certifications for its data centres, including ISO 27001 compliance,PCI Certification, and SOC reports. For more information about their certification and compliance, please visit the <a href="https:/aws.amazon.com/security/" target="_blank">AWS Security website</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/" target="_blank">AWSCompliance website</a> and the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/whitepaper" target="_blank">Google Cloud Platform Securitywebsite</a><h3>Data Encryption In Transit and Stored</h3><p>Humaniq services support the latest recommended secure cipher suites and protocols to encrypt all traffic in transit. Customer Data is E2E encrypted stored.<br /> We monitor the changing cryptographic landscape closely and work promptly to upgrade the service torespond to new cryptographic weaknesses as they are discovered and implement best practices as they evolve. For encryption in transit, we do this while also balancing the need for compatibility with older clients.</p><h3>Disaster Recovery</h3><p>Customer Data (which is to be stored) is stored redundantly at multiple locations in our hosting provider’s data centres to ensure availability. We have well-tested backup and restoration procedures, which allow recovery from a major disaster. Customer Data and our source code are automatically backed up every night. The Operations team is alerted in case of a failure with this system. Backups are fullytested at least every 90 days to confirm that our processes and tools work as expected.</p><h3>Network Protection</h3><p>In addition to sophisticated system monitoring and logging, we have implemented two-factor authentication for all server access across our production environment. Firewalls are configured according to industry best practices and unnecessary ports are blocked byconfiguration with AWS Security Groups and GCP Security Groups.</p>',

        header: 'Risk Disclaimers for HMQ Coinholders',
        html:
          '<p>HMQ IS NOT A SECURITY AND THIS IS NOT AN OFFER TO BUY OR SELL A SECURITY. HMQ IS NOT AN INVESTMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE PURCHASED AS AN INVESTMENT.</p> <p>Anyone purchasing or holding HMQ certifies that they are doing so out of a desire to use or consume HMQ on the Humaniq network, to participate in the Humaniq community and for the utility value of HMQ, and not for any speculative, investment or financial reasons.</p> <h2>Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol.</h2> <p>HMQ and the Humaniq network are based upon the Ethereum protocol. As such, any malfunction, unintended function or unexpected functioning of the Ethereum protocol may cause the Humaniq network or HMQ to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum Protocol, may itself lose value in ways similar to HMQ, and also other ways. More information about the Ethereum protocol is available at http://www.ethereum.org. Humaniq takes no responsibility for outcomes on the Ethereum platform and acknowledges that any adverse outcomes on the Ethereum platform are outside of the direct or indirect control of Humaniq.</p><h2>Risks Associated with Coinholder Credentials. </h2> <p>Any third party that gains access to the coinholder&rsquo;s login credentials or private keys may be able to dispose of the coinholder&rsquo;s HMQ. To minimize this risk, the coinholder should guard against unauthorized access to their electronic devices. Humaniq makes no representation that it will protect the coinholder&rsquo;s login credentials, and it is the duty of the coinholder to guard against unauthorized access to their electronic devices, and Humaniq is in no way responsible for theft of login credentials as a result of the action of the user.</p> <h2>Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions.</h2> <p>Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The functioning of the Humaniq network and HMQ could be impacted by one or more regulatory enquiries or actions, including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of digital tokens like HMQ, which could impede or limit the development of the Humaniq network. Competitive eSports and exchanges of value based on the outcomes of competitive eSports matches, the core business of the Company, have been, and will likely continue to be, the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The legal ability for the Company to operate the Humaniq network in some or all jurisdictions could be eliminated by future regulation or legal actions. In the event that it is not legal for the Humaniq network to operate in a jurisdiction, the Company will cease operations in that jurisdiction. There is a serious risk that the Company will be unable to operate if regulation makes it difficult to do so. Humaniq makes no representations that it has any special knowledge in terms of future regulatory actions by any jurisdiction globally, and makes no representation that these potential future regulatory actions will not adversely affect the value of the Humaniq network and HMQ.</p> <h2>Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Humaniq Networks.</h2> <p>Following the presale and the development of the initial version of the HMQ platform and Humaniq network, it is possible that alternative networks could be established, which utilize the same open source code and open source protocol underlying the Humaniq network. The official Humaniq network may compete with these alternative, unofficial HMQ-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact the Humaniq network and HMQ. Humaniq will make reasonable effort to generate alternative, unofficial Humaniq networks are not created, but makes no representation that this not occur due to circumstances outside of Humaniq&rsquo;s control.</p> <h2>Risk of Insufficient Interest in Humaniq and Distributed Applications.</h2> <p>It is possible that the Humaniq network will not be used by a large number of businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Humaniq network and therefore the potential uses or value of HMQ. &nbsp;Humaniq will make reasonable effort to generate sufficient interest in the Humaniq Network and distributed applications, but makes no representation that this will certainly occur.</p><h2>Risk of Theft and Hacking. </h2> <p>Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Humaniq network or the availability of HMQ in any number of ways, including, but not limited to, denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in executing and enhancing the cybersecurity of the Humaniq network and protect against theft and hacking attacks, but makes no representation that this will certainly occur.</p> <h2>Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography. </h2> <p>Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Humaniq platform, which could result in the theft or loss of HMQ. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in mitigating the risks posed by cryptographic advances and the development of quantum computing, but makes no representations that there will not be risk posed by these advances.</p> <h2>Risk of Security Weaknesses in the HMQ network Core Infrastructure Software.</h2> <p>The Humaniq network consists of open-source software that is itself based on open-source software. There is a risk that the Humaniq team, or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Humaniq network interfering with the use of or causing the loss of HMQ. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in correcting infrastructural weaknesses or bugs in the core infrastructural elements on the Humaniq network on a regular basis, but makes no representations that there will not be bugs or infrastructural weaknesses in the Humaniq network.</p> <h2>Risk of HMQ Mining Attacks. </h2> <p>As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Humaniq network is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to, double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, &ldquo;selfish-mining&rdquo; attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Humaniq network, expected proper execution and sequencing of Humaniq markets, and expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum contract computations. Despite the efforts of the Company, the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in protecting against HMQ mining attacks, but makes no representations that mining attacks will not occur outside of the direct control of Humaniq.</p> <h2>Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the Humaniq Network.</h2> <p>While HMQ should not be viewed as an investment, it may potentially (but likely will not) gain value over time. That value may be limited if the Humaniq network lacks use and adoption. If this becomes the case, there may be few or no markets upon which to utilize HMQ, limiting the value of HMQ. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in driving mass adoption of the Humaniq Network via aggressive fundraising, marketing, public relations, and earned media campaigns, but makes no representations that mass adoption and use of the Humaniq network will occur.</p> <h2>Risk of Dissolution of the Humaniq Project.</h2> <p>It is possible that, due to any number of reasons or risks, either disclosed or unforeseen, including without limitation, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether, Bitcoin, or other cryptographic and fiat currencies, unfavorable fluctuation in the value of HMQ, the failure of business relationships, the dissolution of partnerships, or competing intellectual property claims, the Humaniq network may no longer be a viable business and the Company may dissolve or the Humaniq network may fail to launch. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in ensuring that dissolution of the Humaniq Project does not occur, but makes no representations that losses will not occur as the result of circumstances outside of Humaniq&rsquo;s direct control.</p> <h2>Unanticipated Risks.</h2> <p>Cryptocurrency and cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set forth here, there are risks that the Company cannot anticipate. Risks may further materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the risks set forth here. Humaniq will exercise reasonable care in ensuring that all risks are mitigated, but makes no representations that all risks associated with the Humaniq network, HMQ, and other cryptocurrency concerns have been fully disclosed in this document. To Humaniq&rsquo;s best knowledge, the risks have been fully disclosed, but Humaniq makes no representations that there are not other risks outside of Humaniq&rsquo;s direct control.</p> <p>If you have any further questions regarding this, please email us at <a href=\\"mailto:admin@humaniq.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">admin@humaniq.com</a></p>',
